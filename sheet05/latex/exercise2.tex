\section{Fourier transform}
The continuous Fourier transformation is defined as 
\begin{align}
    F(k) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \exp (ikx) \text{d}x,
\end{align}
whereas the discrete Fourier transformation is given by
\begin{align}
    F_j = \sum_{\ell=0}^{N-1} \Omega_N^{j,\ell} f_\ell.
\end{align}
The fast Fourier transformation, with $N=2^m$ discretization points, for the discrete function
\begin{align}
    f_{\ell} = \sqrt{1 +\ell},
\end{align}
with $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, is implemented according to the lecture. Fig.\ref{fig:ex02_m3} shows the comparison of the real and imaginary part of the direct evaluation with the fast Fourier transformation for $m=3$. Fig.\ref{fig:ex02_m4} shows the comparison for $m=4$.\\
It can be seen, that the values are in agreement with each other.
