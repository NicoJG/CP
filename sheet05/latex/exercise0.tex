\section{Comprehension questions}
\subsection{Applications of FFT in Physics}
The FFT can be used in physics wherever Fourier analysis is used and we have a discrete time signal, for example in the study of materials with x-rays.
\subsection{Methods for Minimizing One-Dimensional Functions}
The intervall halving method, Parabolic approximation and the Newton's method were the methods discussed in the lecture for minimizing one-dimensional functions.
The solution of the first step for the intervall halving method is dependent on the individual case, e.g. whether it is possible to estimate where the minimum
lies approximately. Newton's method converges fast. If the starting value provides a poor estimate, then the intervall halving method should be utilized to receive a good starting approach.
