\section{ Profiling for the study of an algorithm}

Figure \autoref{fig:plot_exercise2} contains the three different times for the three different steps declared in a).
The time is plotted against the size $N$ of the matrix.

\subsection{}
i) The runtime for $N= 1000000$ should be arround $10^{14}$ seconds for the second step in a).\\
ii) The LU-Decomposition with Eigen takes the longest time. Choosing a different, more efficient algorithm would decrease the computation time.
\subsection{}

At a certain size of $N$ the matrix should become so large that it cannot be handled as a whole without causing memory errors.
