\subsection{Implementing a function that calculates all eigenfrequencies of a system}
The system of differential equations from which we can formulate the matrix A should look like the following equation.

\begin{align}
\ddot{x}_{i-1} = \frac{k_{i-1}}{m_i}(x_i - x_{i-1})\\
\ddot{x}_i = - \frac{k_{i-1}}{m_i}(x_i - x_{i-1}) + \frac{k_i}{m_i}(x_{i+1}-x_i)\\
\ddot{x}_{i+1} = \frac{k_{i}}{m_i}(x_{i+1} - x_i)
\end{align}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first and last row of the matrix need to be set first, since there is no prior element for the first row and no following element for the last row 
\item The first row is set with "A.row(0).head(2) << -k(0) / m(0), k(0) / m(0)"
\item The last row is set with "A.row(N - 1).tail(2) << k(N - 2) / m(N - 1), -k(N - 2) / m(N - 1)"
\item The rest of the triagonal matrix A can be set with a for-loop
\end{itemize}
The eigenvalues of the matrix A are now the squared eigenfrequencies.

\subsection{Calculating the eigenfrequencies for a system with $N=10$}

The values for $m_i,k_j$ and $l_j$ are generated according to the rules on the exercise sheet.
The matrix A is then generated by the priorly stated method from the $m_i$ and $k_j$ of the present system.
The eigenfrequencies, calculated with eigen3, are presented in table \ref{tab:freq}.
