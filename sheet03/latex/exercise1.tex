\subsection{Implementing a function that calculates all eigenfrequencies of a system}
The system of $N$ differential equations for the given problem is 
\begin{align}
\ddot{x}_{1} &= \frac{k_1}{m_1}(x_2 - x_1) \\
\ddot{x}_i &= \frac{k_{i-1}}{m_i}(x_{i-1} - x_i) + \frac{k_i}{m_i}(x_{i+1}-x_i) \text{ for } i \in \{2,...,N-1\} \\
\ddot{x}_{N} &= \frac{k_{N-1}}{m_N}(x_{N-1} - x_{N}) \, .
\end{align}
From this we we can formulate the matrix $A$ so that 
\begin{equation}
    \ddot{\vec{x}} = A \vec{x} \, .
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first and last row of the matrix need to be set first, since there is no prior element for the first row and no following element for the last row 
\item The first row is set with "A.row(0).head(2) << -k(0) / m(0), k(0) / m(0)"
\item The last row is set with "A.row(N - 1).tail(2) << k(N - 2) / m(N - 1), -k(N - 2) / m(N - 1)"
\item The rest of the triagonal matrix A can be set with a for-loop
\end{itemize}
The eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of the matrix A are related to the eigenfrequencies $\omega_i \geq 0$ with
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_i = - \omega_i^2 \, .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Calculating the eigenfrequencies for a system with $N=10$}

The values for $m_i,k_j$ and $l_j$ are generated according to the rules on the exercise sheet.
The matrix A is then generated by the priorly stated method from the $m_i$ and $k_j$ of the present system.
The eigenfrequencies, calculated with eigen3, are presented in table \ref{tab:freq}.
