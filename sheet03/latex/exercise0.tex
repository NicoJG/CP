\section{Comprehension questions}
The matrix A needs to be a square matrix and the number of columns needs to be the same as the number of elements in vector $\vec{v}$.
Also Equation
\begin{equation}
A \vec{v} \neq 0
\end{equation}
needs to be true.
The expression from the exercise sheet is the method of the power iteration. Its proof is the reason why the expression converges to the eigenvector of A when increasing the power n.
